With the rise of COVID-19, governments around the world have drastically increased their amount of debt. Within the developed countries, the US' debt-to-GDP ratio has now become 102% and Japan has skyrocketed to 234%, which are staggering numbers. The developing countries have been hit with an even harder blow. Given this renewed interest and concern over debt levels, we decided to gear our project towards providing information that might be of interest to those who work on fiscal and economic development policy.

We will be examining government debt from a few different levels:
1. First, we will look at national debt within the US and how debt levels vary across states. 
2. Next, we will zoom out on a global level to explore the geographical distribution of debt as well as its relationship with the Human Development Index. 
3. Finally, we will explore international debt flows and the network between debtor and creditor nations.
